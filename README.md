# Talking-with-a-database-LLM-project

In this project, I used a made up Tshirt store Rafeeds Tshirts which sells 4 brands of tshirts Nike, Addidas, Levi and Ven Huesen. I have the database table tshirts and discounts which has the dummy data for the store.

In this project, I created a streamlit app that talks with the database, converts the plain text into SQL queries and fetches it back to show the result with the help of Google Palm LLM model.
